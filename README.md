# Anony-MSG

This is a project I have been working on to get a better understanding of server hosting, server-side programming, form submission, and how those things interact with databases. I have been using a basic html face with a small amount of styling for the webpage itself, and have been submitting the contents of the form to a python script located on a server within my home network while I am learning how to implement all the different technologies. In working on this project I've been using Ubuntu server, nginx, MySQL, python for scripting, vim for text editing. I would like to eventually add more to this project. A few of the ideas I've had for it are:
I definitely need to add input sanitization before I host this project on a server publicly.
I would like to add secure connections between the server and clients once I eventually host it, as well as in connection with the MySQL database.
My current implementation of the database doesn't include any timestamps for the entries that it stores, and I would like to add them at some point.
